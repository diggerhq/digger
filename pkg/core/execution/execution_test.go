Note: Objects have changed outside of Terraform

Terraform detected the following changes made outside of Terraform since the

  # docker_image.xxxx has been deleted
  - resource "docker_image" "aaa" {

Unless you have made equivalent changes to your digger_config, or ignored the
relevant attributes using ignore_changes, the following plan may include
actions to undo or respond to these changes.

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
