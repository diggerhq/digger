CI/CD for Terraform is [tricky](https://itnext.io/pains-in-terraform-collaboration-249a56b4534e). To make life easier, specialised CI systems aka [TACOS](https://itnext.io/spice-up-your-infrastructure-as-code-with-tacos-1a9c179e0783) exist - Terraform Cloud, Spacelift, Atlantis, etc.

But why have 2 CI systems? Why not reuse the async jobs infrastructure with compute, orchestration, logs, etc of your existing CI?

Digger runs terraform natively in your CI and takes care of the other bits - locks, plan artifacts and so on. [Demo video](https://www.loom.com/share/e201e639a73941e0b5508710377a6106)


## Features
- üëü Runner-less. Terraform runs in the compute environment of your existing CI such as Github Actions, Gitlab, Argo etc.
- ü™∂ Minimal / no backend. Digger's own backend is a serverless function; it is only needed for certain CI environments (eg Gitlab)
- üîí Code-level locks. Avoid race conditions across multiple PRs. Similar to Atlantis workflow.
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Multi-cloud. At the moment Digger supports AWS and GCP; Azure support coming in April 2023 (yes, in a few weeks).
- üí• Projects. Allow to isolate terraform runs and locks to a specific directory
- üí• Terragrunt support
- üí• Workspaces support

## Roadmap

Need a feature that's not listed? Book a [community feedback call](https://calendly.com/diggerdev/community-feedback) - we ship fast ‚úÖ

- ‚úÖ GCP support. Store PR locks in GCP storage buckets. Shipped in [#50](https://github.com/diggerhq/digger/pull/50)

## How to use

This is demo flow with a sample repo using local state - for real world scenario you'll need to configure remote backend (S3 + DynamoDB) and add a [workflow file](https://github.com/diggerhq/digger_demo/blob/main/.github/workflows/plan.yml) to the root of the repo.

1. Fork the [demo repository](https://github.com/diggerhq/digger_demo_multienv)
2. Enable Actions (by default workflows won't trigger in a fork)

2. In your repository settings > Actions ensure that the Workflow Read and Write permissions are assigned - This will allow the workflow  to post comments on your PRs

3. Add environment variables into your Github Action Secrets (NOTE: This step is optional if you just want to test out the Action with `null_resource`)
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY 
4. make a change and create a PR - this will create a lock
5. comment `digger plan` - terraform plan output will be added as comment. If you don't see a comment (bug) - check out job output
6. create another PR - plan or apply won‚Äôt work in this PR until the first lock is released
7. you should see `Locked by PR #1` comment. The action logs will display "Project locked" error message.

## Remote backend and state-level locks

Digger does not interfere with your remote backend setup. You could be using [S3 backend](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/s3) or TF cloud's [remote backend](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/remote) or [some other way](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/settings/backends/configuration)

Digger also doesn't differentiate locks based on statefiles - if a PR is locked, it's locked for all "instances" of state (aka [Terraform CLI Workspaces](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/workspaces#terraform-cloud-vs-terraform-cli-workspaces))

state-level locks will keep working normally because are handled by terraform itself ([same as in Atlantis](https://www.runatlantis.io/docs/locking.html#relationship-to-terraform-state-locking))


## Notes
- We perform anonymous usage tracking. No sensitive or personal / identifyable data is logged. You can see what is tracked in [`pkg/utils/usage.go`](https://github.com/diggerhq/digger/blob/main/pkg/utils/usage.go)

## FAQ

Q) **Since you're FOSS I assume you plan to monetize by selling support? Or...?**

A) We are a vc-backed startup fully focused on this tool; in terms of monetization - we are currently in the process of launching Digger Pro. Check out the features [here](https://digger.dev/#plans) and feel free to book a [demo](https://bit.ly/diggerpro) if interested.
