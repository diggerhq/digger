CI/CD for Terraform is [tricky](https://itnext.io/pains-in-terraform-collaboration-249a56b4534e). To make life easier, specialised CI systems aka [TACOS](https://itnext.io/spice-up-your-infrastructure-as-code-with-tacos-1a9c179e0783) exist - Terraform Cloud, Spacelift, Atlantis, etc.

But why have 2 CI systems? Why not reuse the async jobs infrastructure with compute, orchestration, logs, etc of your existing CI?

Digger runs terraform natively in your CI. This is:

- Secure, because cloud access secrets aren't shared with a third-party
- Cost-effective, because you are not paying for additional compute just to run your terraform

## Features

- Terraform plan and apply in pull request comments
- Private runners - thanks to the fact that there are no separate runners! Your existing CI's compute environment is used
- Open Policy Agent (OPA) support for RBAC
- PR-level locks (on top of Terraform native state locks, similar to Atlantis) to avoid race conditions across multiple PRs
- Terragrunt, Workspaces, multiple Terraform versions, static analysis via Checkov, plan persistence, ...
- Drift detection 
  

## Getting Started

- [Github Actions + AWS](https://docs.digger.dev/getting-started/github-actions-+-aws)
- [Github Actions + GCP](https://docs.digger.dev/getting-started/github-actions-and-gcp)

## How it works

Digger has 2 main components:
- CLI that runs inside your CI and calls terraform with the right arguments
- Orchestrator - a minimal backend (that can also be self-hosted) that triggers CI jobs in response to events such as PR comments

Digger also stores PR-level locks and plan cache in your cloud account (DynamoDB + S3 on AWS, equivalents in other cloud providers)
