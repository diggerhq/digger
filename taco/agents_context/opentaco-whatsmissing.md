# OpenTaco what’s missing in the world

A TACO like TFC or Spacelift but:

- open source fully (with backend, UI, compute, etc)
- no RUM pricing - just free
- self-hostable (and optimised for scale when self-hosted)
- CI compute is reused (no need for maintaining a cluster) ??

Terrakube / OTF:

- real company behind it
- RBAC
- separate compute (CI orchestration not runners)

Atlantis:

- state management
- HA / scalability
- security
- drift
- policies
