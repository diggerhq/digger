## 💻 Coding Conventions

We strive to maintain a consistent coding style throughout the project. Please follow our [coding conventions](/coding-conventions.md) when making changes to the codebase.

## 📂 Folder Structure

```
libs/ # contains libraries that are common between digger cli and digger cloud backend (should NOT import anything from cli/pkg/ which is cli specific)
cli/cmd/ # contains the main cli files
cli/pkg/ # contains packages that are used by the cli code, can import from libs/
backend/ # contains the backend code, can import from libs/
docs/ # contains documentation pages
```

## 🛠️ Submitting a Pull Request

When you have made changes to the codebase that you would like to contribute back, please follow these steps:

1. 🍴 **Fork the repository** and create a new branch from `develop`.
2. ✏️ **Make your changes** and ensure the code passes all tests.
3. 🧪 **Write tests** for your changes, if applicable.
4. 🔍 **Test your changes** in a demo GitHub repository using GitHub Actions.

   - You can test out the changes from your fork by referencing the Action within a GitHub workflow file: `uses: <github-username>/digger@your-branch`.
   - Fork [this demo repository](https://github.com/diggerhq/digger_demo_multienv) to set up and assert your tests.
   - If you're adding new app-level inputs that imply new environment variables, make sure to reference them **both within the `build digger` and `run digger` steps** in [`action.yml`](./action.yml).

5. 📜 **Update the documentation** to reflect your changes, if applicable.
6. 🔄 **Submit a pull request** to the `develop` branch.

We will review your pull request as soon as possible. Please be patient and open to feedback. We appreciate your contributions! 🙏


## 📦 Release Process

**NOTE: The default branch `@develop` is not guaranteed to be stable and you should always use published release versions in your testing and production environments.**

1. 🔍 **Create a pre-release branch:** Check out a pre-release branch to prepare for an upcoming release using the pattern `prerelease-0.1.xx`.
2. 🧪 **Conduct testing:** Perform additional manual and automated tests in this branch to ensure there are no regressions.
3. 🚀 **Tag the release:** Once we are ready, tag the head of our release branch and perform a release on it.
4. 📣 **Publish tagged releases:** Tagged releases are published as actions and are the most suitable for use in production.
