## Coding conventions
We strive to maintain a consistent coding style throughout the project. Please follow our [coding conventions](/coding-conventions.md) when making changes to the codebase.

## Folder structure

```
cmd/ # contains the main cli files | TODO: refactor into cli/cmd
dockerfiles/ # DEPRECATED - contains the dockerfiles of digger | TODO: remove  
docs/ # contains documentation pages
libs/ # contains libraries that are common between digger cli and digger cloud backend (should NOT import anything from pkg/ which is cli specific)
pkg/ # contains packages that are used by the cli code | TODO: refactor into cli/pkg, can import from libs/
cloud/ # (coming soon) contains the backend code, can import from libs/
```

## Submitting a pull request
When you have made changes to the codebase that you would like to contribute back, please follow these steps:
1. Fork the repository and create a new branch from `develop`.
2. Make your changes and ensure that the code passes all tests.
3. Write tests for your changes, if applicable.
4. Update the documentation to reflect your changes, if applicable.
5. Submit a pull request to the `develop` branch.
   We will review your pull request as soon as possible. Please be patient and open to feedback. We appreciate your contributions!

## Release Process
**NOTE: The default branch `@develop` is not guaranteed to be stable and you should always use published release versions in your testing and production.**

- All pull requests are merged to the default develop branch after initial unit tests and integration tests are passing and required code review requirements are met.
- We checkout a pre-release branch to prepare for an upcoming release with the pattern `prerelease-0.1.xx`.
- We perform additional manual and automated tests in this branch to make sure there are no regressions.
- Once we are ready we tag the head of our release branch and perform a release on it.
- Tagged releases are published as actions and they are the most suitable to be used in production.
