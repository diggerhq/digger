title: "Using digger with gitlab Pipelines"
---


You can use Digger with Gitlab as your VCS and Gitlab pipelines as a CI backend. Currently this is an EE feature only.

### Prerequisites:

- Having a valid Digger EE license key. This needs to be provided by us, please [contact us](https://digger.dev/pricing) to request it
- A Gitlab account.
- A personal Gitlab access token. This can be created from user preferences > access tokens

### Install the digger EE orchestrator:

You need to install the digger EE orchestrator. The installation steps are the same as the steps in [**self hosting docker**](https://docs.digger.dev/self-host/deploy-docker) with some differences:

- For the docker image you will need to use the ee image: https://github.com/diggerhq/digger/pkgs/container/digger_backend_ee **(latest version, v0.6.5 as of this guide)**
- You will need to include the license key environment variable to the backend and the cli: **`DIGGER_LICENSE_KEY=xxxyyy`**
- You can ignore all the steps regarding setting up Github app and all GITHUB_** environment variables
- For gitlab CI configuration you need to specify the following environment variables:

```jsx
DIGGER_CI_BACKEND=gitlab_pipelines
DIGGER_GITLAB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=abc123
DIGGER_GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN=glpat-xxxxyyyyyzzzzz # (this is your gitlab access token from prerequisite step)`
DIGGER_GITLAB_BASE_URL=https://git.mydomain.com/api/v4
```

Other than that if you follow the steps in the self hosting guide you should end up with the orchestrator up and running along with a webhook set for your gitlab POC repo.

### Prepare your repo with a digger.yml

You need to prepare a digger.yml to configure your terraform projects. For that refer to our quickstart guides. For a quick one all you need would be a path to a directory and project name:

```jsx
projects:
  - name: dev
    dir: dev/
```

**Setting up Gitlab webhooks**

In the repo where you are interested to integrate with digger you need to set up a webhook pointing to your digger hostname. Go to Settings > Webhooks and add digger host name. Set the secret token as “abc123” (same as **`DIGGER_GITLAB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`**) above. make sure that “Comments” and “Merge request events” are selected for Trigger events. Finally you can save.

### Create digger pipeline in your gitlab repo

To create a Gitlab pipeline you can use a .gitlab-ci.yml file in the root of your file. In this you need to create a script which downloads Digger binary and invokes it, the purpose here is to have this pipeline triggered by Digger externally. Here is an example of such file:

```jsx

variables:
  DIGGER_LICENSE_KEY: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
  DIGGER_GITLAB_BASE_URL: "https://git.mydomain.com/api/v4" # optional

workflow:
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
      when: never
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "schedule"
      when: never
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "api"
stages:
- digger

image: golang:1.22.4

print_env:
   stage: digger
   script:
     - env

digger_action:
  stage: digger
  script:
    - apt-get update && apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common
    - wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | gpg --dearmor | tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
    - gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg --fingerprint
    - echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
    - apt update
    - apt-get install terraform
    - mkdir -p digger && cd digger && curl -SSL -o digger https://github.com/diggerhq/digger/releases/download/v0.6.5/digger-ee-cli-Linux-X64
    - chmod +x digger
    - cd ../
    - digger
```

This will instruct digger to run the “spec” which is composed and sent from the backend. That should be all you need to set up and try digger!

## Test your setup

In order to test your setup try to create a pull request in your repo. After you Comment “digger plan” You should see in the backend logs that a webhook event was received and an initial comment should be triggered in your pull request.

Your Gitlab should also trigger and also perform a plan. If successful the job will comment back the plan as follows:
