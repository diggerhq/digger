title: "FIPS 140 standard"
---

You can use digger binary with FIPS140 standard. FIPS 140 (Federal Information Processing Standard Publication 140) is a U.S. government standard that specifies security requirements for cryptographic modules protecting sensitive information.

as of version v0.6.101 digger backend and cli are both compiled seperately with FIPS140 enabled. In order to enable it for GitHub follow these steps:

- For the backend you need to ensure you use the right docker image: `_backend_ee_fips` during the pull
- For the cli you need to add the following argument in addition to `ee: true` :

```
    - diggerhq/digger@vLatest
      with:
         ee: 'true'
         fips: 'true'
```

If you are using GitLab or other VCS then just ensure that you are downloading the fips enabled binary which is suffixed with '_fips'
