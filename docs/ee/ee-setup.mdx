---

## Prerequesites
- Digger CE configured
- Automatic access to Actions via Github Connect enabled in Github Enterprise Server - [github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.11/admin/github-actions/managing-access-to-actions-from-githubcom/enabling-automatic-access-to-githubcom-actions-using-github-connect)

## Get a new Digger token
- Go to [cloud.digger.dev](https://cloud.digger.dev)
- Go to API tokens in the sidebar
- Press "Generate Token"
- Copy the value; save securely (you will need it later)

- point `uses` to `diggerhq/digger-ee@v0.2.6-ee` (use relevant version)
- set your Digger token as `DIGGER_TOKEN`
