title: "RBAC"

Digger Enterprise supports granular Role-based Access Contros at 3 levels:

- Organisation
- Repository
- Project

You can set up RBAC in Digger by configuring an Access Policy at the appropriate level of your Management Repo. See [OPA Policies](/ee/opa) for more details.

Every Access Policy is passed the following details about the attempted operation from GitHub:

- user ID of the user who initiated the operation
- team
- list of PR approvers

This way you can implement advanced workflows such as [policy overrides](https://github.com/diggerhq/demo-policy-overrides/pull/9) based on roles and granular permissions.
