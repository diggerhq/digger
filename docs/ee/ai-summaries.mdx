title: "AI Summaries"

AI Summaries allows you to generate a summary of multiple plans when you create a PR. This significantly reduces the cognitive load
on a reviewer of that PR. Lets say someone updated a module that is relied on by multiple projects in a monorepo, this would lead to 20 different plans like in this screenshot:

With AI summaries enabled a summary comment is posted summarise all of the plans below it.
This means that the reviewer now only needs to read the summary and glance through all the plans, saving precious reviewer time!
