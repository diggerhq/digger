title: "Gitlab CI and Pipelines"
---

You can use digger with gitlab as your VCS and gitlab pipelines as a CI backend. Currently this is an EE feature only.


### Prerequisites:

- Having a valid digger EE license key. If you don't have a license key please [contact us](https://calendly.com/diggerdev/diggerdemo) to request an EE trial
- A gitlab account.
- a personal github access token. This can be created from user preferences > access tokens

### Install the digger EE orchestrator:

You need to install the digger EE orchestrator. The installation steps are the same as the steps in [self hosting docker](/self-host/deploy-docker)
with some differences:

- For the docker image you will need to use the ee image: https://github.com/diggerhq/digger/pkgs/container/digger_backend
- You will need to include the license key environment variable to the backend and the cli: `DIGGER_LICENSE_KEY=xxxyyy`
- You can ignore all the steps regarding setting up Github app and all GITHUB_** environment variables
- For gitlab CI configuration you need to specify the following environment variables:

```
DIGGER_CI_BACKEND=gitlab_pipelines
DIGGER_GITLAB_WEBHOOK_SECRET=abc123
DIGGER_GITLAB_ACCESS_TOKEN=glpat-xxxxyyyyyzzzzz # (this is your gitlab access token from prerequisite step)
```

Other than that if you follow the steps in the self hosting guide you should end up with the orchestrator up and running
along with a github app successfully installed. The repo you wish to try with digger should be installed onto the orchestrator.


### Prepare your repo with a digger.yml

You need to prepare a digger.yml to configure your terraform projects. For that refer to our quickstart
guides. For a quick one all you need would be a path to a directory and project name:

```
projects:
  - name: dev
    dir: dev/
```

### Setting up gitlab webhooks

In the repo where you are interested to integrate with digger you need to set up a webhook pointing to your digger hostname.
Go to Settings > Webhooks and add digger host name. Set the secret token as "abc123" (same as `DIGGER_GITLAB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`) above.
make sure that "Comments" and "Merge request events" are selected for Trigger events. Finally you can save.


### Create digger pipeline in your gitlab repo

To create a gitlab pipeline you can use a .gitlab-ci.yml file in the root of your file. In this you need to
create a script which downloads digger binary and invokes it, the purpose here is to have this pipeline triggered
by digger externally. Here is an example of such file:

```
workflow:
  rules:
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "merge_request_event"
      when: never
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "schedule"
      when: never
    - if: $CI_PIPELINE_SOURCE == "api"
stages:
- digger

image: golang:1.22.4

print_env:
   stage: digger
   script:
     - env

digger_action:
  stage: digger
  script:
    - apt-get update && apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common
    - wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | gpg --dearmor | tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
    - gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg --fingerprint
    - echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
    - apt update
    - apt-get install terraform

    # - git clone https://github.com/diggerhq/digger.git
    # - cd digger/cli
    # - pwd
    # - git checkout feat/gitlab-support2
    # - GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o digger ./cmd/digger
    # - PATH=$PATH:$(pwd)
    # - cd ../../
    - mkdir -p digger && cd digger && curl -SSL -o digger https://github.com/diggerhq/digger/releases/download/vLatest/digger-cli-Linux-X64
    - cd ../
    - digger
```

This will instruct digger to run the "spec" which is composed and sent from the backend. That should be
all you need to set up and try digger!

## Test your setup

In order to test your setup try to create a pull request in your repo. After you Comment "digger plan" You should see in the backend logs
that a webhook event was received and an initial comment should be triggered in your pull request. Your
gitlab should also trigger and also perform a plan. If successful the job will comment back the plan as follows:

![](/images/gitlab/gitlab-plan.png)

![](/images/gitlab/gitlab-apply.png)

## Repo allowlist

You can set `DIGGER_REPO_ALLOW_LIST` env variable on the server to define a whitelist of repositories allowed to trigger Digger workflows in Gitlab. This is needed because unlike GitHub, there's no concept of "apps" in Gitlab to allow granular control of per-repo access.

```
DIGGER_REPO_ALLOW_LIST=gitlab.com/diggerdev/digger-demo,gitlab.com/diggerdev/alsoallowed
```
