title: "Running Remote Jobs"
---

With dgctl command line you can run jobs in a remote CI environment and have the logs streamed to your terminal.
These tasks follow the same RBAC rules specified in your [opa policies](/ee/opa). For example this command:

```
dgctl exec --project <project_name> --command "digger plan"
```

Will perform a remote plan for the project. The changes don't need to be pushed to the remote repo for this to function since
the local directory will be zipped and uploaded to the remote CI environment to perform the plan.
