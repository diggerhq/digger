title: "RBAC via OPA"
---

Digger EE supports org-level, repo-level, and project-level OPA policies in a dedicated Management Repo - [example repo](https://github.com/diggerhq/mgmt-repo-one/tree/main/policies)

You can implement advanced fine-grained RBAC workflows with this, for example having "super approvers" that can override the policy block - [example PR](https://github.com/diggerhq/demo-policy-overrides/pull/9)
