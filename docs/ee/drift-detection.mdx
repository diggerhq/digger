title: "Drift Detection"

Digger EE supports drift detection and automatic creation of issues in your ticketing system, e.g. GitHub Issues:

Digger CE only supports drift alert via Slack. It was previously documented under CE; you can still use the basic Slack alerts for free.

Limitations of drift detection in CE:

- Slack as the only destination
- No parallelism - all drift jobs run sequentially

To configure basic drift alerts via Slack:

## Create a separate workflow file for drift

To run digger in drift detection mode, pass `mode: drift-detection` in the workflow file and configure the relevant crontab to run it with the frequency you want:

```
name: Digger Drift Detection

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule: ## 12am daily.
    - cron: '0 0 * * *'

jobs:
  detect-drift:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: digger drift detection
      uses: diggerhq/digger@vLatest
      with:
        mode: drift-detection
        setup-aws: true
        aws-access-key-id: $\{\{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \}\}
        aws-secret-access-key: $\{\{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \}\}
        aws-region: us-east-1
        drift-detection-slack-notification-url: $\{\{ secrets.DRIFT_DETECTION_SLACK_NOTIFICATION \}\}
      env:
        GITHUB_CONTEXT: $\{\{ toJson(github) \}\}
        GITHUB_TOKEN: $\{\{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN \}\}
```

## Configure Slack notification URL

Note the `DRIFT_DETECTION_SLACK_NOTIFICATION` env var that the workflow above is using. This should be set to a Slack Incoming Webhook URL.

Follow the [official Slack guide](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) to get the Incoming Webhook URL; then add it as an Action secret named `DRIFT_DETECTION_SLACK_NOTIFICATION`
