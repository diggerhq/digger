title: "Setting up Azure + GH Actions"
---

## Prerequisites

* Azure Cloud account

## 1\. Create Storage Account for locks

Go to Storage Accounts, press Create. Set name and press Review. Wait for deployment to complete.

Click "Go to Resource"; go to Access keys (on the lefthand side)

Click "show" on the connection string. Copy and save it securely; it will be needed later in this guide.

## 2\. Add Azure keys to Github Actions Secrets

### In Azure

Go to Azure Active Directory -> App Registrations

Click New Registration; give name; click Register

Take note of

* Directory (Tenant) ID

* Application (Client) ID

Go to Certificates and Secrets. Click New Client Secret. Give it a name; click Add. Take note of the Secret Value.

Go to **subscription** in the portal and select your subscription ID, select **Access Control (IAM)** and **Add** the **Role assignment**, **Contributor** to your Service Principal. Take note of your Subscription ID value

### In Github

* Go to Settings → Secrets and Variables

* Click “New Repository Secret” button

* Add a secret named ARM\_CLIENT\_ID with the value of your Application (Client) ID from above

* Add a secret named ARM\_TENANT\_ID with the value of your Directory (Tenant) ID from above

* Add a secret named ARM\_CLIENT\_SECRET with the value of your Client Secret from above

* Add a secret named ARM\_SUBSCRIPTION\_ID with the value of your Subscription ID from above

* Add a secret named DIGGER\_AZURE\_CONNECTION\_STRING with the value of your Connection String from Step 1

In your repository settings > Actions ensure that the Workflow Read and Write permissions are assigned. This will allow the workflow to post comments on your PRs.

## 4\. Create digger.yml file

In your repository, create `digger.yml` file with the following contents:

```
projects:
- name: infra-prod
  dir: prod
```

## 5\. Create a workflow file

In your repository, create a file at `.github/workflows/infra.yml`

```
name: CI

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]
    types: [ closed, opened, synchronize, reopened ]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
    if: contains(github.event.comment.body, 'digger')
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Checkout Pull Request
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        run: |
          PR_URL="${{ github.event.issue.pull_request.url }}"
          PR_NUM=${PR_URL##*/}
          echo "Checking out from PR #$PR_NUM based on URL: $PR_URL"
          hub pr checkout $PR_NUM
        if: github.event_name == 'issue_comment'
    
      - name: digger
        uses: diggerhq/digger@main
        env:
          GITHUB_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(github) }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          LOCK_PROVIDER: azure
          DIGGER_AZURE_AUTH_METHOD: CONNECTION_STRING
          DIGGER_AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING: ${{ secrets.DIGGER_AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING }}
          ARM_CLIENT_ID: ${{ secrets.ARM_CLIENT_ID }}
          ARM_CLIENT_SECRET: ${{ secrets.ARM_CLIENT_SECRET }}
          ARM_TENANT_ID: ${{ secrets.ARM_TENANT_ID }}
          ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: ${{ secrets.ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}          
```

## 6\. Create a PR to verify that it works

Just make any change to Terraform - like add a blank line

An action should start. After some time you should see a comment of lock being aquired in your PR. Something like this:

```
Project diggerhq/azure-onboarding-test#infra-prod has been locked by PR #1
```
