title: "Plan Persistence"

The output of \`terraform plan\` can be stored either in GitHub Artifacts, or in a GCP bucket. When you run apply, Digger will pick up the stored plan.

Use the following workflow option to use Artifacts plan storage:
```
upload-plan-destination: github
```
Or to use a GCP bucket:
```
upload-plan-destination: gcp
```
