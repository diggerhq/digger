title: "Concurrency"
---

With Digger plans / apply jobs that do not depend on each other run in parallel. This makes execution much faster, often by a large factor, for example when a change in a module affects multiple state files.

Digger does not run its own compute; instead it's an orchestrator that starts jobs in your CI. So concurrency is natural with this architecture.
