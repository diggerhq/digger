title: "Plan preview"
---

* The default way of working with digger is creating a pull request, previewing the plan within the PR as a comment, approving and applying the change within the change and then merging the pull request to the default branch

* This guarantees that any pull request merged to the default branch reflects the infrastructure (since the apply will succeed before merging the pull request)

* By performing locks on pull request we guarantee that the plan preview on the pull request is not stale. i.e. the infrastructure was not touched by another subsequent change
