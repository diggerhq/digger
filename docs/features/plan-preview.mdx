Digger runs `terraform plan` whenever a pull request is raised, and appends output as comment

Digger run report also contains other useful info e.g. results of policy checks.

You can also re-plan by commenting `digger plan` (see [CommentOps](/features/commentops))


* The default way of working with digger is creating a pull request, previewing the plan within the PR as a comment, approving and applying the change within the change and then merging the pull request to the default branch

* This guarantees that any pull request merged to the default branch reflects the infrastructure (since the apply will succeed before merging the pull request)

* By performing locks on pull request we guarantee that the plan preview on the pull request is not stale. i.e. the infrastructure was not touched by another subsequent change
