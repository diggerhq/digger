title: "Using OPA (Conftest)"

You can configure Digger to use Conftest to check your Terraform plan output against Open Policy Agent policies.

## Pre-requisites

* Conftest binary needs to be installed into your CI pipeline (see [Conftest Docs](https://www.conftest.dev/install/))

* OPA policies (rego files) under `/policies` directory in your repo

## Digger.yml configuration

Example assumes the terraform is in the `prod` directory.

Don't forget to update the json file name as well if your directory is named differently

```
projects:
- name: prod
  dir: prod
  workflow: my_custom_workflow
workflows:
  my_custom_workflow:
    plan:
      steps:
      - init:
      - plan
      - run: "conftest test ./prod.json -p ../policies"
    workflow_configuration:
      on_pull_request_pushed: [digger plan]
      on_pull_request_closed: [digger unlock]
      on_commit_to_default: [digger apply]
```
