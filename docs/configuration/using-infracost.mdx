<Note>You can configure Digger to use Infracost to estimate cloud costs.</Note>

## Pre-requisites

Infracost binary needs to be installed into your CI pipeline (see [Infracost docs](https://www.infracost.io/docs/integrations/generic%5Fcicd/))

## Digger.yml configuration

```
projects:
  - name: project_a_d
    dir: ./project_a/development
    workflow: project_a

workflows:
  project_a:
    plan:
      steps:
        - init
        - plan
        - run: infracost breakdown --path=.
```

## See cost estimate output

After the pipeline run finishes, you should see Infracost breakdown output in your CI job logs:
