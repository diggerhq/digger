title: "Setting up separate mgmt account"
---

You can use separate AWS accounts for Digger locks and target infrastructure.

* If you only pass `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` env vars, same account will be used for both

* If in addition you also pass `DIGGER_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `DIGGER_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` vars then those will be used for Digger locks, and the first pair will be used as target account
