### Github 
By default Digger uses Github Artifacts to store `terraform plan` outputs.

### GCP 
You can also configure plan outputs to be uploaded to GCP Buckets instead. This is handy in case you want your plan outputs to stay within your organisationâ€™s network for security or compliance reasons.

To change change digger to upload the plan to GCP set the follow environment variables in the digger_workflow.yml file

```
PLAN_UPLOAD_DESTINATION = 'gcp'
GOOGLE_STORAGE_PLAN_ARTEFACT_BUCKET = 'terraform-plan-output-1239123'
```

### AWS 
You can also use AWS S3 buckets to store plan outputs.  

To change digger to upload the plan to AWS S3 set the following environment variables in the digger_workflow.yaml

```
PLAN_UPLOAD_DESTINATION = 'aws'
AWS_S3_BUCKET = 'terraform-plan-output-1239123'
```
