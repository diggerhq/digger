---

## Pre-requisites

- Infracost binary installed into your CI pipeline (see [Infracost docs](https://www.infracost.io/docs/integrations/generic%5Fcicd/))
- Infracost API key

## Set up Infracost

Use the official setup-infracost action in your workflow file ([README](https://github.com/infracost/actions/))

```
- name: Setup Infracost
        uses: infracost/actions/setup@v2
        # See https://github.com/infracost/actions/tree/master/setup for other inputs
        # If you can't use this action, see Docker images in https://infracost.io/cicd
        with:
          api-key: ${{ secrets.INFRACOST_API_KEY }}
```

## Digger.yml configuration

```
projects:
- name: production
  dir: prod
  workflow: with-infracost

workflows:
  with-infracost:
    plan:
      steps:
        - init
        - plan
        - run: infracost breakdown --path=. | tee -a $DIGGER_OUT
```

## See cost estimate output

After the pipeline run finishes, you should see Infracost breakdown output appended to digger run report comment as additional output:
