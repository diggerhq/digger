title: "Using Infracost"
---

## Pre-requisites

- Infracost binary installed into your CI pipeline (see [Infracost docs](https://www.infracost.io/docs/integrations/generic%5Fcicd/))
- Infracost API key

## Set up Infracost

Use the official setup-infracost action in your workflow file ([README](https://github.com/infracost/actions/))

```
- name: Setup Infracost
        uses: infracost/actions/setup@v2
        # See https://github.com/infracost/actions/tree/master/setup for other inputs
        # If you can't use this action, see Docker images in https://infracost.io/cicd
        with:
          api-key: ${{ secrets.INFRACOST_API_KEY }}
```

## Breadkdown

Use digger.yml like below to see `infracost breakdown` output: 

```
projects:
- name: production
  dir: prod
  workflow: with-infracost

workflows:
  with-infracost:
    plan:
      steps:
        - init
        - plan
        - run: infracost breakdown --path=. | tee -a $DIGGER_OUT
```

After the pipeline run finishes, you should see Infracost breakdown output appended to digger run report comment as additional output:

## Diff

For `infracost diff` we'd need to run Infracost twice: first to generate the breakdown on the main branch, then to generate diff on the PR branch. To help with that, Digger provides additional environment varialbes like `$PROJECT_NAME` and `$PR_BRANCH` (see [custom commands](/howto/custom-commands)). You can then configure your workflow in digger.yml to switch branch to main, generate base breakdown, switch back to PR branch, generate diff and finally show it via `$DIGGER_OUT`, like below:

```
steps:
        - init
        - plan
        - run: infracost breakdown --path=. | tee -a $DIGGER_OUT
        - run: git checkout $DEFAULT_BRANCH && infracost breakdown --path . --format=json --out-file=$RUNNER_TEMP/infracost-base-${PROJECT_NAME}.json && git fetch origin $PR_BRANCH && git checkout $PR_BRANCH
        - run: infracost diff --path=. --compare-to=$RUNNER_TEMP/infracost-base-${PROJECT_NAME}.json | tee -a $DIGGER_OUT
```
