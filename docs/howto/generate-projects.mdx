title: "Generate projects"
---

Sometimes specifying every project in digger.yml by hand is suboptimal, especially with a large number of small statefiles.
In this scenario you can use the `generate_projects` directive in digger.yml. Digger will then traverse the directory according to `include_patters` and `exclude_patterns` provided and dynamically generate the list of projects

```
generate_projects:
  include: "projects/dev/*"
  exclude: "projects/dev/test3"
```
