title: "Generate projects"
---

Sometimes specifying every project in digger.yml by hand is suboptimal, especially with a large number of small statefiles.
In this scenario you can use the `generate_projects` directive in digger.yml. Digger will then traverse the directory according to `include_patters` and `exclude_patterns` provided and dynamically generate the list of projects

```
generate_projects:
  include: "projects/dev/*"
  exclude: "projects/dev/test3"
```

# Blocks syntax

You can also specify multiple include / exclude entries like this:

```
generate_projects:
  blocks:
    - include: "environments/core/**"
      workflow: default_work_flow
    - include: "environments/cicd/**"
      workflow: default_work_flow
    - include: "environments/dev/**"
      workflow: default_work_flow
    - include: "environments/qa/**"
      workflow: default_work_flow
```

# Traversing nested directories

You can optionally set the top-level argument `traverse_to_nested_projects` to generate a project for all sub-directories:

```
traverse_to_nested_projects: true
generate_projects:
  blocks:
    - include: "environments/core/**"
```

This will create a project for all sub-directories under environments/core. If set to `false`, only the first directory with a .tf file will be evaluated.

# Blocks syntax with Terragrunt

You can use blocks generation with terragrunt as well. In order to acheive this all you need to do is specify
`terragrunt: true` for each block. Normally you would only have one terragrunt structure and so you will have
one block entry. However you may be also interested to specify different structure and different parameters
for different folders. For example, you may have a dev, staging and prod account heirarchy and therefore you
would specify the blocks in that way. Alternatively maybe you have different providers and you would like to
specify those different providers as well. Note that for very large terragrunt monorepos segragating by blocks
will lead to improved performance since it will not unnecessarily traverse an entire tree if no files have been
changed within it.

```
generate_projects
    blocks:
      - block_name: dev
        terragrunt: true
        root_dir: "dev/"
        workflow: default
        workflow_file: digger_workflow_dev.yml
      - block_name: staging
        terragrunt: true
        root_dir: "staging/"
        workflow: default
        workflow_file: digger_workflow_staging.yml
```
