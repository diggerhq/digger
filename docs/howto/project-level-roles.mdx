title: "Project Level Roles for AWS"
---

Multi-account setups are pretty common. In many cases you want to use a different account for
different sets of projects. If you wish to acheive this outside of digger and only use profile names and set
them directly in terraform you can use this as an [example repository](https://github.com/diggerhq/demo-assume-role-multi-account-aws)

You can also use digger.yml to specify which roles should be used for which repository. In this case you specify a main
role in the workflow file using `aws-role-to-assume` (or using keys) and inside the repo if you wish to assume
a differnt role for a specific project you specify an `aws_role_to_assume` under that project. 
If you only specify one role (either `state` or `command`) it is assumed that both options are the same role.

Example digger.yml:

```
projects:
   - name: dev
      dir: ./dev
      aws_role_to_assume:
         state: "arn:/blabla/accid/backenddev"
         command: "arn:/blabla/accid/devaccount"
   - name: prod
      dir: ./prod
      aws_role_to_assume:
         state: "arn:/blabla/accid/backendprod"
         command: "arn:/blabla/accid/prodaccount"
```

Using a workflow file as usual. Here is an [example repository](https://github.com/diggerhq/demo-assume-role-multi-account-aws_diggeryml) using digger.yml to assume differnt roles for differnt projects.

<Note>
NOTE: for locking to be configured user needs to also pass aws-role-to-assume in the workflow file as a
parameter within the workflow file. This role needs to have ability to assume all the other roles and also have access to a common account where the locks are to live. 

If you are not using a aws-role-to-assume setting it workflow you **must** add ```AwsRoleRegion``` property to project level ```aws_role_to_assume```
</Note>

You can also use project-level assume role with [generated projects](/howto/generate-projects):

```
generate_projects:
  blocks:
    - include: "environments/core/**"
      aws_role_to_assume:
        aws_role_region: "us-east-2" 
        state: "arn:/blabla/accid/backenddev"
        command: "arn:/blabla/accid/devaccount"
```
