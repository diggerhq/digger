title: "Custom commands"
---

You can specify custom steps using the `workflows` section in digger.yml. Handy for integration with other CLIs like infracost.

```
projects:
- name: production
  dir: prod
  workflow: with-infracost

workflows:
  with-infracost:
    plan:
      steps:
        - init
        - plan
        - run: infracost breakdown --path=. | tee -a $DIGGER_OUT
```

## Environment variables

Digger makes the following environment variables available to custom commands:
- `$DEFAULT_BRANCH`
- `$DIGGER_OUT`
- `$PR_BRANCH`
- `$PROJECT_NAME`

These can be used to achieve workflows like [infracost diff](/howto/using-infracost)

## $DIGGER_OUT

If your custom command writes into a file path defined in the `$DIGGER_OUT` env variable, then its content will be appended to the comment as "additional output":

![](/images/custom-command-output-infracost.png)

The value of `$DIGGER_OUT` defaults to `$RUNNER_TEMP/digger-out.log`; you can change that if needed by setting the env var explicitly.
