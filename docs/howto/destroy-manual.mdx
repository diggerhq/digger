title: "Destroy via manual workflow"
---

Normally Digger workflow is not supposed to be triggered manually. It is triggered ether by the orchestrator backend, or directly by an event from GitHub (in the "backendless" mode with `no-backend: true` option set). The Destroy operation is a special case, by design: the only way to run `terraform destroy` in Digger is by triggering a workflow manually. This way unwanted destroys are guaranteed to never happen.

You can create a dedicated workflow accepting project name and action:

```
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      project:
        description: 'Digger project to perform destroy on'
        required: true
jobs:
  destroy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - name: digger destroy
      uses: diggerhq/digger@vLatest
      with:
        mode: manual
        command: "digger destroy"
        project: "$\{\{ inputs.project \}\}"
        setup-aws: true
        aws-access-key-id: $\{\{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID \}\}
        aws-secret-access-key: $\{\{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY \}\}
        aws-region: us-east-2
      env:
        GITHUB_CONTEXT: $\{\{ toJson(github) \}\}
        GITHUB_TOKEN: $\{\{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN \}\}
```

<Note>
  Note the arguments “mode: manual” and “command: digger destroy” above are
  different from the default workflow
