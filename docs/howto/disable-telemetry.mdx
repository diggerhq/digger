title: "Disable telemetry"
---

Digger collects anonymized telemetry. See [usage.go](https://github.com/diggerhq/digger/blob/develop/cli/pkg/usage/usage.go) for detail. You can disable telemetry collection either by setting `telemetry: false` in digger.yml, or by setting the `TELEMETRY` env variable to `false`.
