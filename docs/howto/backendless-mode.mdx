title: "Backendless mode"
---

Digger works best as a 2-piece solution:

- a CLI that runs inside your CI
- an orchestrator backend that triggers the CI jobs ([GitHub App](https://dashboard.digger.dev) or [self-hosted](/self-host/deploy-docker))

You can however stil use the most basic features of Digger as a standalone action without a backend. To do that, set the following option in your workflow configuration:

```
no-backend: true
```

You'd also need to add `pull_request` and `issue_comment` workflow triggers:

```
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]
    types: [ opened, synchronize ]
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]
  workflow_dispatch:
```

# Limitations

Historically this was the original way of running Digger. The initial version called "tfrun" didn't have any backend, it was just a GitHub action. But it quickly became apparent that without some sort of orchestration there's only so much that can be done:

- No concurrency; all plans / applies need to run sequentially, which is slow
- Action starts on every push or comment, often just to detect that there are no changes. That's expensive, especially in large repos.
- Clashing applies from other jobs will fail as they cannot be queued
- Buckets / tables for PR-level locks need to be configured manually in your cloud account
- Comments and status checks will be updated with a delay
