title: "Include / exclude patterns"
---

You can specify wildcard and glob patterns in digger.yml to include multiple directories into a project. A common use case for this is if you have multiple environment folders and they import from a common `modules` directory:

```yml
development/
  main.tf
production/
  main.tf
modules/
  shared_moduleA/
  dev_only_module/
```

<Note>
    The path of include / exclude patterns is relative to the digger.yml location - NOT the project location
</Note>

If you wanted to trigger plans for all `modules/` folder in both dev and prod projects you would include them in the `include_patterns` key. Similarly you put anything which you want to ignore in the `exclude_patterns` key ( exclude takes precedence over includes).

```yml
projects:
  - name: dev
    dir: ./development
    include_patterns: ["./modules/**"]
    workflow: default_workflow
  - name: prod
    dir: ./production
    include_patterns: ["./modules/**"]
    exclude_patterns: ["./modules/dev_only_module/**"]
```
