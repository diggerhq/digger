description: 'Set up Digger to run Terraform in Bitbucket Pipelines CI'
---


## Prerequisites
- A Bitbucket repository with Terraform code (like this starter repo - link)
- An AWS, GCP or Azure account

## 1. Get Digger API key

Log into Digger app (link), copy the token and save it securely

## 2. Create digger.yml

Commit `digger.yml` file to the root of your repository. Make sure `dir` is pointing to your Terraform code

```
projects:
- name: infra-dev
  dir: infra
```

## 3. Create Pipeline

Click "pipelines" in the left sidebar in Bitbucket. Select "Starter Pipeline" template.

Replace the code with the following:

```
# Example Digger pipeline for Bitbucket

image: diggerhq/digger-bitbucket:3 (TODO provide an image)

pipelines:
  default:
    - parallel:
      - step:
          name: 'Digger Plan'
          script:
            - echo "Your build and test goes here..."
      - step:
          name: 'Digger Apply'
          script:
            - echo "Your linting goes here..."
```

### Set environment variables

Click "Add Variables"

| Key                   | Value                            |
| ----------------------| ---------------------------------|
| DIGGER_TOKEN          | Your Digger API key from step 1  |
| DIGGER_AWS_KEY        | Your AWS key                     |
| DIGGER_AWS_SECRET     | Your AWS secret                  |

Digger supports multiple authentication methods (such as OIDC) for multiple cloud providers.
For more detail, check out reference pages for AWS, GCP and Azure (links)

## 4. Test that it works

Make a change to your Terraform code. Commit and push to a branch. Create a pull request.

Go to Pipelines. You should see a Digger pipeline started:

Now go back to the pull request. You should see a comment with plan output appended:

(screenshot)

Now comment "digger apply" and go to Pipelines. You should see another pipeline started and Terraform apply outputs in the logs:
