title: "GitHub Actions + AWS"
---

# Prerequisites

- Repo with Terraform code ([basic example](https://github.com/diggerhq/demo-opentofu) using null_resource)

# Step 1: create your Digger account

Head to [next.digger.dev](https://next.digger.dev) and sign up using your preferred method.

You should see an empty dashboard after you sign up.

# Step 2: create a project

- In the dashboard, click "Create Project".
- Pick a name
- Install GitHub app into your repository with Terraform by clicking on "Configure GitHub"

# Step 3: create secrets for AWS keys

In GitHub repository settings, go to Secrets and Variables - Actions. Create the following secrets:

- `DIGGER_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
- `DIGGER_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

In production, it is best to [use OIDC](/ce/cloud-providers/authenticating-with-oidc-on-aws)

# Step 4: create a workflow in GitHub

Create a `digger_workflow.yml` file under `.github/workflows` in your repo with the following contents:

```
name: Digger Workflow

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      spec:
        required: true
      run_name:
        required: false

run-name: '${{inputs.run_name}}'

jobs:
  digger-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write # required to merge PRs
      actions: write # required for plan persistence
      id-token: write # required for workload-identity-federation
      pull-requests: write # required to post PR comments
      statuses: write # required to validate combined PR status

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: ${{ fromJSON(github.event.inputs.spec).job_id }}
        run: echo "job id ${{ fromJSON(github.event.inputs.spec).job_id }}"
      - uses: diggerhq/digger@vLatest
        with:
          digger-spec: ${{ inputs.spec }}
          setup-aws: true
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.DIGGER_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.DIGGER_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          setup-terraform: true
          terraform-version: 'v1.5.5'
          disable-locking: true
          #digger-private-key: '${{ secrets.DIGGER_PRIVATE_KEY}}'
        env:
          GITHUB_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(github) }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

# Step 5: make a change to your Terraform

Merge a PR or push a change straight into your main branch.

You should see a new Run in your project in your Digger dashboard. After a few seconds, its status will change to "Running Plan". You should then see a new job appear in your GitHub Actions. When it finishes, you can see plan in Digger Dashboard, and approve it - which will start an Apply job.
