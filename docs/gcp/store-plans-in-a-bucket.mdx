title: "Store plans in a Bucket"
---

By default Digger uses Github Artifacts to store `terraform plan` outputs.

You can configure it to use GCP Buckets instead. This is handy in case you want your plan outputs to stay within your organisationâ€™s network for security or compliance reasons.

To do it, set the `PLAN_UPLOAD_DESTINATION` env var to `gcp in your Actions.`
