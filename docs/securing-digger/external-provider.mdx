title: "External providers code execution"
---

Digger executes terraform in github actions within previlliged environments. Since terraform has the ability
to execute arbitrary code based on data blocks or external providers this can lead to a user with mallicious
intent to expose the environment variables within the CI environment, potentially leaking cloud secrets.

How to avoid this?
---
Currently we are exploring solutions to avoid this security threat. The first thing you should do is to
not use long-lived credentials to connect to your cloud account. Instead rely on OIDC for short-lived
credentials to minimise the exposure from this threat. Secondly its important to ensure that only trusted
individuals are allowed to update the terraform code. We are also working on additional solutions to secure
against this threat. For more details and to engage in the discussion please take a look at this github issue:
