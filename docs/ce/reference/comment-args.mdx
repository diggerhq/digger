title: Comment Args
---

Digger comments such as `digger plan` and `digger apply` accept the following flags:

```
-d value
    	directory (short form)
  -directory value
    	directory (long form)
  -p value
    	project (short form)
  -project value
    	project (long form)
  -layer value (only for layering)
    	layer to plan or apply (default -1)
```

The -p and -d flags can be specified multiple times. In the case of projects they will select the projects from the flags.
Same goes for directories. Some example comments with flags:

```
digger plan -p dev_vpc
```

```
digger plan --project dev_vpc
```

```
digger plan -d dev/vpc
```

```
digger plan --directory dev/vpc
```

```
digger plan -p dev_vpc -p staging_vpc
```

```
digger plan -p dev_vpc -d staging/vpc
```
