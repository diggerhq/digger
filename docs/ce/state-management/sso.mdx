### Auth0 

Auth0 is currently our most tested integration. As a first step go to their site and signup: https://auth0.com

![Landing Page](/images/state-management/sso/auth0-landing.png)

Once you sign up, go to applications: 

![Getting Started Page](/images/state-management/sso/auth0-getting-started.png)

Once you're in applications click create new application.

![Application Page](/images/state-management/sso/auth0-applications.png)

Select native application, and click create

![Create Application](/images/state-management/sso/auth0-create-application.png)

Click over to settings to see all the environment keys we need

![Application Result](/images/state-management/sso/auth0-application-result.png)

We place the Auth0 domain as the `OPENTACO_AUTH_ISSUER` <br /> 
We put the Auth0 client ID here `OPENTACO_AUTH_CLIENT_ID` <br /> 
We put the Auth0 client secret `OPENTACO_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`<br /> 


 
 For Auth0 we can configure our URLs like so: 

`OPENTACO_AUTH_AUTH_URL="https://Your-Auth0-domain.url/authorize"` <br /> 
`OPENTACO_AUTH_TOKEN_URL="https://Your-Auth0-domain.url/oauth/token"` <br /> 

### Okta 
First Sign up for Okta 
![Landing Page](/images/state-management/sso/okta-landing-page.png)

Once you're in, go to their applications tab and click "Create App Integration" 

![Applications](/images/state-management/sso/okta-applications.png)

Select "OIDC" and "Native Application" 

![New Integration](/images/state-management/sso/okta-new-integration.png)

After that you can see the ClientID: 

![Client ID](/images/state-management/sso/okta-client-id.png)

And if you click edit in the general settings area shown above, you can add the appropriate callback uris

For taco login we only need http://localhost:8585/callback. If you plan to use cloud block with Okta you'll need to add the group of callback uris Terraform login can depend on here is a list: 

```
   http://localhost:10000/callback
   http://localhost:10001/callback
   http://localhost:10002/callback
   http://localhost:10003/callback
   http://localhost:10004/callback
   http://localhost:10005/callback
   http://localhost:10006/callback
   http://localhost:10007/callback
   http://localhost:10008/callback
   http://localhost:10009/callback
   http://localhost:10010/callback
    
```

![Client ID](/images/state-management/sso/okta-callback-uri.png)

We should also visit assignments and add users we want to be able to sign in. 

![Assignments](/images/state-management/sso/okta-assignments.png)

In the top right menu we can also see our domain, for my user it is' https://trial-6850125.okta.com'

![Domain](/images/state-management/sso/okta-domain.png)

With these we can construct our env: 

For auth issuer its [our domain]/oauth2/default

`OPENTACO_AUTH_ISSUER="https://trial-6850125.okta.com/oauth2/default"`

We take the client id from the general tab, which in this case was 0oavp3b0875RJX2IV697

`OPENTACO_AUTH_CLIENT_ID="0oavp3b0875RJX2IV697"`

Then our auth url and our token url are [our domain]/oauth2/default/v1/authorize or token, like so:

`OPENTACO_AUTH_AUTH_URL="https://trial-6850125.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/authorize"`
`OPENTACO_AUTH_TOKEN_URL="https://trial-6850125.okta.com/oauth2/default/v1/token"`
