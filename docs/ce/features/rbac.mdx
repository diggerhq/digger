title: "RBAC"
---

For simple usecases you can rely on [CODEOWNERS](/ce/howto/codeowners) in order to control what is achievable in the PR.OPA can be used in advanced scenarios to get more control. Digger supports granular Role-based Access Controls at 3 levels:

- Organisation
- Repository
- Project

You can set up RBAC in Digger by configuring an Access Policy at the appropriate level of your Management Repo. See [OPA Policies](/ce/features/opa-policies) for more detail.

Every Access Policy is passed the following details about the attempted operation from GitHub:

- user ID of the user who initiated the operation
- team
- list of PR approvers

This way you can implement advanced workflows such as [policy overrides](https://github.com/diggerhq/demo-policy-overrides/pull/9) based on roles and granular permissions.
