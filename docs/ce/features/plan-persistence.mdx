By default digger will run an apply based on the branch pull request files (no artefacts stored). In order to configure plan artefacts you can configure the inputs for storing as github artefacts or aws buckets or gcp buckets. The corresponding artefacts to be configured can be found in [storing plans in a bucket](/ce/howto/store-plans-in-a-bucket)
