title: "Plan Persistence"
---

By default, Digger runs the apply step on the pull-request branch files (no artifacts are stored). To enable plan artifact persistence, configure the inputs to store them as GitHub artifacts, AWS buckets, or GCP buckets. The corresponding artifacts are documented in [storing plans in a bucket](/ce/howto/store-plans-in-a-bucket).
