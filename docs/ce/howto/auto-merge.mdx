title: "Auto-merge"
---

You can set `auto_merge: true` option to automatically merge the PR when all checks pass (including successful apply). Note that it's a top-level setting, not project level:

```
projects:
- name: development
  dir: dev
- name: production
  dir: prod
auto_merge: true
auto_merge_strategy: "squash" # optional, only supported on GitHub
```

If you are using GitHub VCS you can also specify
`auto_merge_strategy` to define the type of strategy. Possible values are:

- squash: for squash merge
- rebase: for rebase merge
- merge: for merge commits merge
