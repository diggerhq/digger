title: "Ignore pull request events"
---

By default digger will run on every pull request event, figure out impacted projects, start jobs automatically
and lock them. If you would like digger to ignore all pull request by default and only react to digger plan / digger apply
comments you can achieve this by setting the environment variable `DIGGER_IGNORE_PULL_REQUEST_EVENTS=1` on your selfhosted instance
