title: "Specifying version"
---

<Warning>
  For serious usecases always use a commit SHA reference to the digger action, of the format `@<40-character-commit-SHA>`. We recommend using a commit SHA from one of [our releases](https://github.com/diggerhq/digger/releases), since this will download a compiled binary. In addition to being faster to run, it is also more secure than using a commit from a branch or tag.
</Warning>

## Use vLatest tag

The default and recommended way of versioning Digger is to use the vLatest tag, which always points to the latest release. The difference compared to just specifying "latest" is that it is a release with pre-built binaries, so it is faster than building from a branch, which using "latest" effectively does.

```
- name: digger
  uses: diggerhq/digger@vLatest
  env:
    ...
```

## Use a pinned version

To pin a specific release of Digger, look up the release in [our releases](https://github.com/diggerhq/digger/releases). Copy the full commit SHA from the release and use it in your workflow file:

```
- name: digger
  uses: diggerhq/digger@28a8ecd4ccb31f9196b1cbc9ceb14025059f97dc # v0.6.93
  env:
    ...
```

## Use latest commit from a branch

You can also run latest commit from a specific branch

Only use this at your own risk in non-production scenarios. This can break things!
