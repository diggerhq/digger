  is also more secure than using a commit from a branch

## Use vLatest tag

The default and recommended way of versioning Digger is to use the vLatest tag, which always points to the latest release. The difference compared to just specifying "latest" is that it is a release with pre-built binaries, so it is faster than building from a branch, which using "latest" effectively does.

```
- name: digger
  uses: diggerhq/digger@vX.Y.Z
  env:
    ...
```

## Use a pinned version

To pin a specific release of Digger, you can use `@vX.Y.Z` tag in your workflow file:

```
- name: digger
  uses: diggerhq/digger@vX.Y.Z
  env:
    ...
```

## Use latest commit from a branch

You can also run latest commit from a specific branch

Only use this at your own risk in non-production scenarios. This can break things!
