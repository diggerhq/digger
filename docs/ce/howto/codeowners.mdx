title: "Codeowners integration"
---

With Github's CODEOWNERS integration, you can configure pull requests to be reviewed by specific team members, depending on the files changed.

Since digger automatically queries github's API for mergability status of the pull request before apply, no additional changes are needed to make
digger integration with CODEOWNERS. Here is an example CODEOWNERS file:

```
prod @ZIJ # ensure ZIJ is reviewer for any prod changes
```

And to enforce it at the PR level we need to add a branch protection rule to the default branch, ensuring to check CODEOWNERS reviewers
settings > branches > "Require review from Code Owners"

Once this is in place any PR will not be mergable unless the CODEOWNERS reviewers approve it. As a consequence, digger will block any apply for such a PR:
