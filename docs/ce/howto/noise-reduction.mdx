title: Reducing PR Noise
---

The current behaviour of digger is that it leaves a comment for every plan or apply performed. It also leaves a summary comment on top of those.
While this is noise to see a quick history of activity within the PR, it gets noisy for anything over 10 impacted projects.

In such cases you can disable the reporting entirely using digger.yml:

```
reporting:
  comments_enabled: false
```

With that in place you will no longer see an individual plan per comment, you can go into the checks page to see the individual plans
