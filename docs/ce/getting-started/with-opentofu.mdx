title: "With OpenTofu"
---

In this tutorial, you will set up Digger to automate OpenTofu pull requests using Github Actions

**Prerequisites**
- A GitHub repository with valid OpenTofu code
- Your cloud provider credentials:
  - For AWS: [Hashicorp's AWS tutorial](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/aws-build)
  - For GCP: [Hashicorp's GCP tutorial](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/gcp-get-started/google-cloud-platform-build)
  - For Azure: [Hashicorp's Azure tutorial](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/azure-get-started/azure-build)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your Digger account">

Head to [otaco.app](https://otaco.app) and sign up using your preferred method.

You should see an empty dashboard after you sign up.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the Digger GitHub App">

Install the Digger [GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/digger-pro/installations/select_target) into your repository.

<Note>
Digger GitHub App does not need access to your cloud account, it just starts jobs in your CI. All sensitive data stays in your CI job.

You can also [self-host Digger orchestrator](/ce/self-host/deploy-docker) with a private GiHub app and issue your own token

</Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Action Secrets with cloud credentials">

In GitHub repository settings, go to Secrets and Variables - Actions. Create the following secrets:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="AWS">
    - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` You can also [use
    OIDC](/ce/cloud-providers/authenticating-with-oidc-on-aws) for AWS
    authentication.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="GCP">
    - `GCP_CREDENTIALS` - contents of your GCP Service Account Key json file You
    can also [use OIDC](/gcp/federated-oidc-access/) for GCP authentication.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Azure">
    - `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` - Your Azure App Registration Client ID
    - `AZURE_TENANT_ID` - Your Azure Tenant ID
    - `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` - Your Azure Subscription ID
    
    You'll need to configure OIDC authentication by setting up federated credentials in your Azure App Registration. See [Azure OIDC setup](/ce/azure-specific/azure) for details.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create digger.yml">

This file contains Digger configuration and needs to be placed at the root level of your repository. Assuming your OpenTofu code is in the `prod` directory:

```
projects:
- name: production
  dir: prod
```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Github Actions workflow file">

Place it at `.github/workflows/digger_workflow.yml` (name is important!)

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="AWS">
    ```yaml

    ```

    This workflow includes additional steps for GCP:
    - Authenticate into GCP using Google's official [Auth action](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth). Note the `create_credentials_file: true` option; without it, subsequent steps that rely on [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc) will not work.
    - Set up Google Cloud SDK for use in the subsequent steps via Google's official [Setup-gcloud action](https://github.com/google-github-actions/setup-gcloud)
    - Verify that GCP is configured correctly by running `gcloud info`

    This workflow uses Azure OIDC authentication, which requires:
    - Setting up federated credentials in your Azure App Registration for GitHub Actions
    - The `id-token: write` permission for workload identity federation
    - ARM_* environment variables for the Azure Terraform provider

  <Step title="Create a PR to verify that it works">

OpenTofu will run an existing plan against your code.

Make any change to your OpenTofu code e.g. add a blank line. An action run should start (you can see log output in Actions). After some time you should see output of OpenTofu Plan added as a comment to your PR.

Then you can add a comment like `digger apply` and shortly after apply output will be added as comment too.
