## Slack rollup notifications

- Configure an org-level Slack Incoming Webhook to receive a rollup of project drift statuses.
- In backendless mode, pass the webhook URL to the action input `drift-detection-slack-notification-url`.
- In backend mode, set the webhook URL in org settings; the service sends messages on schedule.

## Testing and common issues

- Verify the webhook URL works by sending a test message from your environment.
- If messages are missing around the expected time, check the configured schedule (Actions cron or org-level crontab).

## GitHub Issues

- To create issues for drift instead of (or in addition to) Slack messages, see [GitHub Issues](/ce/drift/github-issues).
