title: "Remediation"
---

If you use the GitHub Issues integration for drift, you can remediate directly from the issue by commenting a Digger command.

## Apply changes from the issue

- Comment `digger apply` in the GitHub issue created for the drift event.
- Digger runs the apply for the impacted project(s) and reports status back.

## Notes

- This flow is specific to the GitHub Issues integration. If you are not using Issues, remediate by opening a PR with fixes and using your normal PR flow.
