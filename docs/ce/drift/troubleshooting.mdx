## Common issues

- 403 or permission errors when reporting results
  - Ensure `no-backend: true` is set in backendless workflows.
  - Confirm tokens used by the workflow have the required scopes.

- Slack messages not received
  - Verify the webhook URL and that it’s configured in the correct place (action input or org settings).
  - Check the configured schedule (Actions cron or org-level crontab).

- Issue creation failures
  - Confirm the token has permission to create issues in the repository.

## Operator tips (self-host)

- Check service logs around the scheduled run time.
- Use the SQL helpers in `drift/scripts/cron/` to invoke internal endpoints on a predictable cadence.
