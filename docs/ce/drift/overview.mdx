title: "Drift Overview"
---

Drift is any difference between your real-world cloud resources and the desired state in code. Digger detects drift by running non-destructive plans on a schedule and reporting results.

## What it covers

- Detection: Scheduled plans on your default branch for every enabled project.
- Modes: Run via GitHub Actions only (backendless mode) or via the Digger backend service.
- Outcomes: No changes vs changes detected. Follow up via notifications and remediation.

## When to use which mode

- Backendless mode: Fastest to adopt, everything runs fully in GitHub Actions.
- Backend service: Centralized scheduling, org-level settings, and Slack rollups.

## Next steps

- Understand the architecture: see [How It Works](/ce/drift/how-it-works).
- Set up with GitHub Actions: see [Quickstart](/ce/drift/quickstart-github-actions).
- Choose notifications: see [Notifications](/ce/drift/notifications) and [GitHub Issues](/ce/drift/github-issues).
- Remediate detected drift: see [Remediation](/ce/drift/remediation).
