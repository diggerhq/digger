You can create a GitHub Issue whenever drift is detected, to route remediation through your normal triage process. Digger supports sending a summary of Drift notifications via Slack. Another way to get notified is via [Slack](/ce/drift/slack-notifications)


## Enable in GitHub Actions

Add the following to your drift workflow:

```
env:
  GITHUB_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(github) }}
  GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
  INPUT_DRIFT_GITHUB_ISSUES: 'true'
  # Optional: DIGGER_GITHUB_TOKEN or PAT with appropriate scopes
```

## Notes

- Ensure the token has permission to create issues in the repository.
- The issue records the project(s) with drift and links back to context for quick follow-up.

## Next step

- See [Remediation](/ce/drift/remediation) for closing the loop by applying from the issue.
