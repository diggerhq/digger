## GitHub Actions cron (backendless mode)

- Use the `on.schedule` cron in your workflow to control when drift runs.
- Example: `- cron: '0 0 * * *'` runs daily at midnight UTC.

## Backend scheduling (backend service)

- Configure the org-level `drift_cron_tab` to decide when scans occur.
- The drift service batches scans per org and triggers plan runs for enabled projects.
- SQL helpers to invoke the internal endpoints on a schedule are provided under `drift/scripts/cron/`.

## Choosing a schedule

- Start daily for most teams; increase frequency for fast-moving environments or decrease for large estates.
