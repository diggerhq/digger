Use this minimal workflow to run drift detection entirely in GitHub Actions (backendless mode).

```
name: Digger Drift Detection

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *' # daily at 00:00 UTC

jobs:
  detect-drift:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Digger drift detection
        uses: diggerhq/digger@vLatest
        with:
          mode: drift-detection
          no-backend: true
          setup-terraform: true
        env:
          GITHUB_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(github) }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

## Next steps

- Slack alerts: configure a webhook URL and reference it in the workflow. See [Notifications](/ce/drift/notifications).
- GitHub Issues: enable issue creation for detected drift. See [GitHub Issues](/ce/drift/github-issues).
- Scope which projects are scanned on each schedule. See [Scoping Projects](/ce/drift/scoping-projects).

## Troubleshooting

- If you see 403 or permission errors during reporting, ensure `no-backend: true` is set when running backendless.
