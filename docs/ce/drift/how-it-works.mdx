Digger supports two ways to run drift detection.

## Backendless mode (GitHub Actions only)

- You schedule a workflow that runs the Digger action with `mode: drift-detection`.
- The action fetches your `digger.yml`, enumerates projects, runs plan-only checks, and reports results.
- Projects are checked sequentially (slower)
- Optional: send Slack webhooks or create [GitHub Issues](/ce/drift/github-issues) from the workflow.

## Backend service with cron

- A separate drift service runs on your infrastructure or in Digger Cloud.
- It uses an org-level crontab (`drift_cron_tab`) to decide when to scan.
- Internally it triggers plan runs per enabled project and updates project status in the backend.
- Projects can run in parallel (faster)
- You can configure a Slack Incoming Webhook at the org level to receive rollup notifications.

## Notes for operators

- The service exposes internal endpoints to process drift and send Slack notifications; protect them with the webhook secret.
- SQL helpers for periodic invocations are under `drift/scripts/cron/`.
