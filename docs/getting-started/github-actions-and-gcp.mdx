title: "Github Actions + GCP"
---

In this tutorial, you will set up Digger to automate terraform pull requests using Github Actions and GCP.

# Prerequisites
- A GitHub repository with valid terraform code. Here's a [demo repo](https://github.com/diggerhq/demo-conftest-gcp/) for inspiration.
- A GCP Service Account Key json file. See [Hashicorp's GCP tutorial](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/gcp-get-started/google-cloud-platform-build)
- Digger token from [cloud.digger.dev](https://cloud.digger.dev). You can also [self-host Digger](/self-host/deploy-binary)

# Create Action Secrets
In GitHub repository settings, go to Secrets and Variables - Actions. Create the following secrets:
- `GCP_CREDENTIALS` - contents of your GCP Service Account Key json file
- `DIGGER_TOKEN` - your Digger token (cloud or self-hosted)

# Create digger.yml
This file contains Digger configuration and needs to be placed at the root level of your repository. Assuming your terraform code is in the `prod` directory:
```
projects:
- name: production
  dir: prod
```

# Create Github Actions workflow file
Place it at `.github/workflows/digger_workflow.yml` (name is important!)

```
name: Digger

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      id:
        description: 'run identifier'
        required: false
      job:
        required: true
jobs:
  digger-job:
    name: Digger
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - id: 'auth'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/auth@v1'
      with:
        credentials_json: '${{ secrets.GCP_CREDENTIALS }}'
        create_credentials_file: true
    - name: 'Set up Cloud SDK'
      uses: 'google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v1'
    - name: 'Use gcloud CLI'
      run: 'gcloud info'
    - name: digger run
        uses: diggerhq/digger@latest
        with:
          setup-aws: false
          disable-locking: true
          digger-hostname: 'https://cloud.digger.dev'
          digger-organisation: 'digger'
          digger-token: ${{ secrets.DIGGER_TOKEN }}
        env:
          GITHUB_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(github) }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

This file defines a workflow with 5 steps:
- Checkout repository using Github's official [Checkout action](https://github.com/actions/checkout)
- Authenticate into GCP using Google's official [Auth action](https://github.com/google-github-actions/auth). Note the `create_credentials_file: true` option; without it, subsequent steps that rely [Application Default Credentials](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/provide-credentials-adc) will not work.
- Set up Google Cloud SDK for use in the subsequent steps via Google's official [Setup-gcloud action](https://github.com/google-github-actions/setup-gcloud)
- Verify that GCP is configured correctly by running `gcloud info`
- Run Digger. Note that `DIGGER_TOKEN` needs to be set as a secret in Actions (either repository secret, or environment secret)


# Create a PR to verify that it works

Make any change to your terraform code e.g. add a blank line. An action run should start (you can see log output in Actions). After some time you should see output of Terraform Plan added as a comment to your PR:

```
Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_compute_instance.vm_instance will be created
  + resource "google_compute_instance" "vm_instance" {
      + can_ip_forward       = false
      + cpu_platform         = (known after apply)
      + current_status       = (known after apply)
      + deletion_protection  = false
      + guest_accelerator    = (known after apply)
      + id                   = (known after apply)
      
 ... (further content omitted)
```

Then you can add a comment like `digger apply` and shortly after apply output will be added as comment too.
