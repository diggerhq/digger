title: "Github Actions + AWS"
---

In this tutorial, you will set up Digger to automate terraform pull requests using Github Actions and AWS 

# Prerequisites
- A GitHub repository with valid terraform code. Here's a [demo repo](https://github.com/diggerhq/quickstart-actions-aws)
- Your AWS credentials. See [Hashicorp's AWS tutorial](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/aws-build)
- Digger token from [cloud.digger.dev](https://cloud.digger.dev). You can also [self-host Digger](/self-host/deploy-binary)

# Create Action Secrets
In GitHub repository settings, go to Secrets and Variables - Actions. Create the following secrets:
- `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` (you can also [use OIDC](https://docs.digger.dev/cloud-providers/authenticating-with-oidc-on-aws)
- `DIGGER_TOKEN` - your Digger token (cloud or self-hosted)

# Create digger.yml
This file contains Digger configuration and needs to be placed at the root level of your repository. Assuming your terraform code is in the `prod` directory:
```
projects:
- name: production
  dir: prod
```

# Create Github Actions workflow file
Place it at `.github/workflows/digger_workflow.yml` (name is important!)

```
name: Digger Workflow

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      id:
        description: 'run identifier'
        required: false
      job:
        required: true
jobs:
  digger-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:    
      contents: write      # required to merge PRs
      id-token: write      # required for workload-identity-federation
      pull-requests: write # required to post PR comments
      statuses: write      # required to validate combined PR status

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: diggerhq/digger@v0.3.0
        with:
          setup-aws: true
          aws-access-key-id: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
          aws-secret-access-key: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}
          disable-locking: true
          digger-hostname: 'https://cloud.digger.dev'
          digger-organisation: 'digger'
          digger-token: ${{ secrets.DIGGER_TOKEN }}
        env:
          GITHUB_CONTEXT: ${{ toJson(github) }}
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
         
```

This file defines a simple workflow that
- Checks out repository using Github's official [Checkout action](https://github.com/actions/checkout)
- Runs Digger. Note that `DIGGER_TOKEN` needs to be set as a secret in Actions (either repository secret, or environment secret), you also need to set AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY parameter. OIDC is also supported if you prefer that route

# Create a PR to verify that it works

Terraform  will run an existing plan against your code. 

Make any change to your terraform code e.g. add a blank line. An action run should start (you can see log output in Actions). After some time you should see output of Terraform Plan added as a comment to your PR. 

Then you can add a comment like `digger apply` and shortly after apply output will be added as comment too.
