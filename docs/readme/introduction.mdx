- Unlike application code, terraform code has state. This makes CI/CD for it [painful](https://itnext.io/pains-in-terraform-collaboration-249a56b4534e)
- You could use a dedicated CI like Terraform Cloud or Atlantis, known as [TACOs](https://itnext.io/spice-up-your-infrastructure-as-code-with-tacos-1a9c179e0783)
- But then you end up duplicating your CI/CD infrastructure - compute, jobs, logs etc
- And you need to give it admin access to your cloud accounts

## Run Terraform in your CI

Digger spins up jobs in your existing CI instead of running its own CI-like infrastructure. This is:
- More scalable, because the on-demand compute of your CI is reused
- More secure, because your sensitive data never leaves the CI job

## Compared to Atlantis
- No need to host and maintain a server
- Secure by design
- Scalable computing with jobs isolation
- Role-based access control via OPA

Read more about differences with Atlantis in our [blog post](https://medium.com/@DiggerHQ/digger-and-atlantis-key-differences-c08029ffe112)

## Compared to Terraform Cloud and other TACOs
- Open source
- No duplication of the CI/CD stack
- Secrets not shared with a third party

## Support for other CI's

We are currently designing Digger to be Multi-CI, so that in addition to GitHub Actions, you can run Terraform/OpenTofu within other CIs such as Gitlab CI, Azure DevOps, Bitbucket, TeamCity, Circle CI and Jenkins, while still having the option to orchestrate jobs using Digger's [Orchestrator Backend](https://docs.digger.dev/self-host/deploy-docker).

Read more in this [blog](https://blog.digger.dev/how-we-are-designing-digger-to-support-multiple-ci-systems/), and please share your requirement on [Slack](https://bit.ly/diggercommunity) if you require support for other CI's. Your feedback/insight would help us a lot as this feature is in active development.
