title: "How it works"
---

Digger has 2 main components:

- A CLI agent that runs in your CI and interacts with Terraform CLI
- An orchestrator backend that responds to events from GitHub and triggers CI jobs

When a PR is opened, Digger starts a CI job that runs `terraform plan` and posts plan output as comment. You can then comment "digger apply" to run `terraform apply`. Digger can also be configured to run apply only after the PR has been merged; to check plan output against OPA policies; to run drift detection on schedule; and so on.

The orchestrator backend does not have access to your cloud account, or terraform ates, or plan output, or tfvars, or any other sensitive data. It just triggers CI jobs; your sensitive data never leaves the high-trust environment of your CI. For this reason, there is little reason to self-host the backend of Digger (although you still can). Much easier to use the managed cloud version of the orchestrator.

<Note>
Digger can also run as a standalone GitHub Action without a backend. In this case:
- comments and status checks will be updated with a delay
- all applies will run sequentially in one job without concurrency
- clashing applies from other jobs will fail as they cannot be queued
- buckets / tables for PR-level locks need to be configured manually in your cloud account
</Note>
