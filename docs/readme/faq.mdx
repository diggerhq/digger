# Does Digger support CI systems other than GitHub Actions?

Currently, Digger only supports GitHub Actions. We understand that many users would like support for GitLab Pipelines and other CI systems. While we've made experimental attempts to partially support various CI backends in the past, we are currently focused on providing a best-in-class experience for GitHub users.

# Does Digger support Terraform 1.6 and 1.7?

Digger does not officially support Terraform versions 1.6 and above (any version released after Hashicorp's switch to BSL, [announced](https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-adopts-business-source-license) in August 2023). We recommend using [OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) instead, a community fork of Terraform in response to Hashicorp's license change. OpenTofu is [governed](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/announcing-opentofu) by Linux Foundation and [pending](https://github.com/cncf/sandbox/issues/81) CNCF sandbox.
